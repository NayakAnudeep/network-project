# Educational Network Analysis - System Architecture

This document explains the architectural design of the Educational Network Analysis Dashboard.

## Overview

The system is built using a Django web framework with a focus on network analysis for educational data. It models the relationships between three primary entities: students, instructors, and courses.

## Component Architecture

The application follows a standard Django MVC architecture:

1. **Models** - Database schema for educational entities
2. **Views** - Dashboard visualizations and data processing
3. **Templates** - User interface components
4. **Network Analysis** - Core algorithms for network analysis

## Data Model

The data model consists of five main components:

1. **Student** - Represents a student in the educational system
2. **Instructor** - Represents an instructor who teaches courses
3. **Course** - Represents a course offered in the curriculum
4. **Enrollment** - Tracks student enrollment in courses
5. **Assessment** - Records student performance assessments

### Entity Relationships

- A student can enroll in multiple courses
- A course can have multiple instructors
- An instructor can teach multiple courses
- An assessment connects a student, course, and instructor

## Network Representation

The system models two primary networks:

1. **Student-Instructor Network** - Bipartite network with:
   - Nodes: Students and instructors
   - Edges: Assessment relationships
   - Attributes: Assessment scores, counts

2. **Course Network** - Single-mode network with:
   - Nodes: Courses
   - Edges: Shared student enrollments
   - Attributes: Number of shared students

## Component Breakdown

### Data Generation and Import

1. `generate_data.py` - Creates synthetic educational data
2. `import_data.py` - Imports generated data into Django models

### Network Analysis

The `network_analysis.py` module provides functions for:

1. Building the student-instructor network
2. Building the course network
3. Calculating network metrics
4. Rendering network visualizations
5. Generating analytics for UI components

### Dashboard Views

1. `dashboard` - Main overview dashboard
2. `student_instructor_network` - Student-instructor network analysis
3. `course_network` - Course relationship network analysis
4. `student_performance` - Academic performance analytics

### Detail Views

1. `student_detail` - Individual student profile
2. `instructor_detail` - Individual instructor profile
3. `course_detail` - Individual course profile

### API Endpoints

RESTful endpoints that provide data for the front-end:

1. `api_student_instructor_network` - Student-instructor network data
2. `api_course_network` - Course network data
3. `api_student_performance` - Performance analytics data

## Technology Stack

1. **Backend**:
   - Django 4.x (Web framework)
   - NetworkX (Network analysis)
   - Matplotlib (Data visualization)
   - NumPy/Pandas (Data processing)

2. **Frontend**:
   - Bootstrap 5 (UI framework)
   - Chart.js (Interactive charts)
   - D3.js (Network visualization)

## Data Flow

1. Data generation or import populates the database
2. When a user accesses a dashboard view:
   - The view calls network_analysis functions
   - Network analysis builds graph objects
   - Analysis functions calculate metrics
   - Visualization functions render network graphics
   - View passes data to template for rendering

3. For detail views:
   - Entity-specific data is retrieved
   - Related entities are queried
   - Custom metrics are calculated
   - Data is passed to detail templates

## Network Algorithm Design

The system uses several network analysis algorithms:

1. **Centrality Measures**:
   - Degree centrality - Identifies entities with many connections
   - Betweenness centrality - Identifies bridge entities

2. **Community Detection**:
   - Louvain method - Identifies closely connected groups

3. **Network Metrics**:
   - Density - Measures network connectivity
   - Path analysis - Analyzes connection distances
   - Component analysis - Identifies separate subnetworks

## Performance Considerations

1. For large educational datasets:
   - Network calculations are optimized for memory usage
   - Visualization uses sampling for large networks
   - Database queries use Django's prefetch_related for efficiency

2. Caching is implemented for:
   - Network graphs
   - Visualization images
   - Complex metrics

## Extension Points

The architecture is designed for extensibility:

1. **Additional Networks**:
   - Student-student collaboration networks
   - Resource usage networks
   - Time-based progression networks

2. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Predictive modeling for student success
   - Anomaly detection for outlier performance
   - Temporal analysis for network evolution

3. **Integration Options**:
   - LMS integration via API
   - SSO authentication
   - External reporting systems

## Security Considerations

1. All views require authentication (`@login_required`)
2. API endpoints use CSRF protection
3. Database queries use parameterized queries
4. Visualization rendering prevents code injection

## Deployment Architecture

The application is designed to be deployed in various configurations:

1. **Development**: Local Django server with SQLite
2. **Testing**: Containerized with Docker Compose
3. **Production**: Scalable deployment with:
   - Web server (Nginx/Apache)
   - WSGI server (Gunicorn)
   - Database (PostgreSQL)
   - Static file serving (AWS S3 or similar)
