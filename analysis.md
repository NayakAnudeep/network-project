# Network Simulation Analysis

## 1. Data Structure
- **Core Entities**: Students, Instructors, Courses, Enrollments, and Assessments
- **Relationships**: Student-Instructor connections through assessments, Student-Course connections through enrollments

## 2. Network Graph Construction
- **Student-Instructor Network**: Bipartite graph where students and instructors are nodes, connected when an instructor assesses a student
- **Course Network**: Graph where courses are nodes, connected when they share enrolled students

## 3. Analysis Methods
- **Centrality Analysis**: Identifies key/influential entities using degree and betweenness centrality
- **Community Detection**: Groups related entities using Louvain method or connected components
- **Similarity Analysis**: Identifies related mistakes using Jaccard similarity
- **PageRank**: Determines importance of nodes in the networks

## 4. Knowledge Graph Features
- **Mistake Clustering**: Groups similar mistakes to identify common error patterns
- **Weakness Detection**: Analyzes student performance to identify knowledge gaps
- **Grading Consistency**: Identifies potential inconsistencies in grading similar work
- **Section Recommendations**: Suggests relevant learning materials based on mistakes

## 5. Visualization
- **Graph Rendering**: Creates network visualizations with NetworkX and Matplotlib
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Student, instructor, and course-specific views
- **Performance Analytics**: Displays grade distributions, GPA analysis, and assessment statistics

## 6. Integration
- **ArangoDB Backend**: Stores graph data for advanced queries and relationships
- **Django Frontend**: Renders visualizations and provides user interfaces
- **API Layer**: Connects visualizations with data analysis functions

The simulation provides valuable insights for educational analytics, helping identify relationships between academic entities and patterns in student performance.
